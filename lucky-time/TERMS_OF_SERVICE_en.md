# Lucky Time — Terms of Service

**Effective date:** 2025-12-29  
**App name:** Lucky Time  
**Contact:** `aleksey.blekot@gmail.com`

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using Lucky Time (the “App”), you agree to these Terms of Service (the “Terms”). If you do not agree, do not use the App.

These Terms are in addition to any terms you agree to with the app store provider (for example, Google Play or Apple App Store).

## 1. What Lucky Time is (and is not)

Lucky Time provides information and insights that may include astrology and calendar-based recommendations (including auspicious/inauspicious time suggestions and related content).

**Lucky Time is not a substitute for professional advice.** The App does not provide medical, psychological, legal, or financial advice. Any decisions you make based on the App are your responsibility.

## 2. Eligibility

You must be legally able to enter into these Terms in your jurisdiction. If you are under the age of majority, you may use the App only with permission of a parent or legal guardian who accepts these Terms.

## 3. Privacy

Your privacy is important. Please review the App’s privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to understand how information is handled. If there is any conflict between these Terms and the Privacy Policy regarding data handling, the Privacy Policy controls.

## 4. No accounts; no paid subscriptions (current version)

The current version of Lucky Time does not require accounts or login, and does not offer paid subscriptions or “Pro” features. If we add these features in the future, we may update these Terms accordingly.

## 5. Acceptable use

You agree not to:

- reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive source code from the App except where permitted by law,
- interfere with the App (including probing, scanning, or testing vulnerabilities),
- use the App to violate any law or infringe anyone’s rights, or
- misuse the App to harass, abuse, or harm others.

## 6. Intellectual property

The App and its content (including text, graphics, and UI) are owned by the developer or licensors and are protected by applicable laws.

Subject to these Terms, you are granted a **personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable** license to use the App for your own personal, non-commercial use.

**Open source note:** Portions of the App may be provided under open-source licenses (for example, the MIT License). Those licenses govern the use of the open-source code to the extent applicable.

## 7. Third-party services and links

The App may use or link to third-party services (for example, app store services, device features, or external websites). Your use of third-party services is governed by their terms and policies. We are not responsible for third-party services.

## 8. Disclaimers

The App is provided **“as is”** and **“as available.”** To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

We do not guarantee:

- the accuracy or completeness of any content,
- that any recommended time is “correct,” “lucky,” or will result in a particular outcome,
- that the App will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, or
- that defects will be corrected.

## 9. Limitation of liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event will the developer be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or related to your use of (or inability to use) the App.

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer’s total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the App will not exceed the amount you paid (if any) for the App in the **12 months** preceding the event giving rise to the claim (or, if you paid nothing, **USD $0**).

Some jurisdictions do not allow certain limitations of liability, so some of the above may not apply to you.

## 10. Indemnity

To the extent permitted by law, you agree to indemnify and hold harmless the developer from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising out of or related to:

- your use of the App,
- your violation of these Terms, or
- your violation of any rights of another.

## 11. Termination

You may stop using the App at any time. We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if you violate these Terms or if we are required to do so by law.

Sections that by their nature should survive termination (including intellectual property, disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnity, and dispute terms) will survive.

## 12. Changes to the App or Terms

We may update the App and/or these Terms from time to time. If changes are material, we may provide notice within the App or by other reasonable means. Continued use of the App after an updated version of the Terms becomes effective means you accept the updated Terms.

## 13. Governing law

These Terms are governed by the laws of **Ukraine**, without regard to conflict of law principles, except where your local consumer protection laws require otherwise.
