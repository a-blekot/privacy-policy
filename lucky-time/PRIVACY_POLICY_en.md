**Effective date:** 2025-12-29  
**App name:** Lucky Time  
**Contact:** `aleksey.blekot@gmail.com`

This Privacy Policy explains how Lucky Time (the “App”) handles information.

## 1. Summary

- The App is designed to work **without an account**.
- We do **not knowingly collect** personally identifiable information (PII) from you.
- Most information (such as preferences) is stored **locally on your device**.

## 2. Information the App may use on your device

Depending on your use of the App, it may process and store locally:

- **App preferences** (for example, language, theme, and other settings).
- **Locations you select or save** (used to calculate times and recommendations).

## 3. Information sent over the network

The App may access the internet to load content or perform calculations that require network access (if such features are enabled in your build/version).

When you open external links (for example, to these policy documents), your browser or the linked service may receive standard information such as your IP address and user agent. That processing is controlled by the third party’s privacy policy.

## 4. Third-party services

The App may rely on third-party services provided by the platform or other vendors (for example, app store services). If any third-party SDKs or services are used in your version of the App, their data handling is governed by their own policies.

## 5. Children’s privacy

The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## 6. Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will publish updates with a new effective date.
